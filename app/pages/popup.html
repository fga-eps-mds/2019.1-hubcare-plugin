      <h3>Active</h3>
      <p>First of all, it is necessary 
        to verify if the repository has 
        some activity, a live code that 
        is growing up; or it is inactive, 
        just like some trunk with old stuff.</p>

      <h3>Support</h3>
      <p>When choosing some software to 
        consume, it is important to expect 
        some support from the maintainers. 
        After all, you never know about the 
        true reliability of small free software, 
        but is always cool to give a chance.</p>

    <div id="box-welcoming" class="box">
      <h3>Welcoming</h3>
      <p>Imagine spending hours willingly to 
        improve or fix a problem of a software. 
        So you test your solution, send a 
        Pull Request and is it, nobody cares 
        to your hard work.</p>
